#BENHNOUK Mohamed ;)

Thank you so very much for all of your invaluable chances you give me. The code challenge were greatly appreciated.

#First Look
===========
When I was presented with the challenge, I decided that, at the very least, I would get some good experience.

It turned out to be a good way for me to get to know the hiring company a bit better; it gave me an understanding of what they might expect for the role and from their developers in general.

The challenge also gave me chance to try a new frameworkâ€Š[Swiper].

Most of my frontend experience is with Js and jQuery.

#Setting up the work Environement
First things first, the work environement have a total affect on the workflow.

As a startup i used my personnal laptop which is totaly configured with necessary tools.

I used visual Studio code as my main compiler and all diferent browser to test the final result.

Downloaded the necessary framework [Swiper].

#The Chanllenge Begins
======================
The Challenge was to build a Widget Similar to Welcome To The Jungle web site's widget.
# 3 types of  Blocks (Images, Videos, Quotes).
# Column and row number are pre defined, and its values changes on      mobile devices.
# Use of Swiper Framework.
# Each block has its own hover, focus... functionalities.

#Work Methode
=============

I used a basic diagram (Images, Script, Style, Index).

Images folder contains all pictures(downloaded from Pexels.com) and SVG to work with.

Script Contain Native Js and Swiper framework.

an Compiled SCSS file is used in Style Folder (i prefer work with SCSS rather than CSS directly).

An Index.HTML file containt HTML code blocks.

#Whats have done?
=================
Most of the steps are done.
A design similar to Welcome to the jungle Web site, with small differences.

Use of seperated Blocks (Images and Videos).

Pre-defined column and row values.

Pagination progress Bar with Swiper framework and a slide (1 Column per slide).

Button to slide right and left (keyboard slide option is enabled).

Hover and layout functionalities are implemented.

Media Queries are set.

#Issues
=======
progress Bar Pagination cannot be positioned on the bottom of the slider container.

Most of animation won't work such as slide button hover animation and Play button hover and search icon showing up animation.

Image zoom with hover functionality dosn't work.

#As a result
============
I couldn't finish the challenge as expected, but i learned many things and know to hundle many other thanks.

This code challenge made more dynamic with work and issues fix and how to hundle much of problems.
